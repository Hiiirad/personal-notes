# Notes

> This repository is going to be outdated over time. I would appreciate it if anyone could help me keep it up-to-date.

I believe technology helps us to think differently in every way. So I believe everyone deserves to learn things. Sometimes the most challenging part of starting something is the first step in that direction, so these notes will help you with that very first step, and I hope you do the rest.

I am not going to teach you details of that technology, but I categorize everything so that you can quickly find what you need.
