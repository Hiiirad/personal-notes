I believe technology helps us to think differently in every way. So I think everyone deserves to learn things. Sometimes the hardest part of starting something is the first step in that direction, so these notes are going to help you with that very first step, and I hope you do the rest.

I am not going to teach you details of that technology, but I will categorize everything so that you can find what you need quickly.
